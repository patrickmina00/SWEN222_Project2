# SWEN222_Project2
Task:
The goal for this assignment is to create a game that allows multiple people to play. It should make use of 4 properties namely; 
it should use client-server architecture, have a receiving “controller” and a game logic. For this project, we were assigned
groups where we will work in.


Technology Used: Eclipse, GitHub, Trello


Actions Taken:
After the group had agreed with the specifics of the project (such as what game it is and how will it function). 
A friend and I took the responsibility of implementing the client – server architecture. It was decided that we will use an 
older lab assignment that uses the said architecture and modify it such that it will fit our needs. Both me and my friend 
also did some minor contributions to the other parts of the project such as making the game controller to accept proper inputs 
and outputs from the client/server. I also made the parser for both client and server such that it is able to read the inputs 
from both client and server.
